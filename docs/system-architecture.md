# Blockchain-Based Voting System: System Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of our Blockchain-Based Voting System, which uses Hyperledger Fabric to provide a secure, transparent, and privacy-preserving e-voting platform integrated with Indian identity verification systems.

## System Components

### 1. Hyperledger Fabric Network

The blockchain network forms the foundation of our system and consists of:

- **Organizations**:
  - Election Commission (root authority)
  - State Election Offices
  - District Election Offices

- **Channels**:
  - One channel per constituency to ensure data isolation and privacy

- **Nodes**:
  - Endorsing peers (State Election Offices)
  - Committing peers (District Election Offices)
  - Ordering service (Election Commission)

- **Certificate Authorities**:
  - Hierarchical structure with root CA (Election Commission) and intermediate CAs per state

### 2. Smart Contracts (Chaincode)

Two primary chaincodes handle the business logic:

- **Voting Chaincode**:
  - Election initialization and management
  - Vote casting and tallying
  - Result calculation and verification

- **Identity Chaincode**:
  - Voter registration and verification
  - Candidate registration
  - Polling station registration
  - Token issuance for voting

### 3. Backend Services

RESTful APIs that connect the frontend applications to the blockchain:

- **Identity API**:
  - Aadhar verification
  - Voter ID validation
  - Biometric validation
  - Zero-knowledge proof generation

- **Admin API**:
  - Election management
  - Candidate registration
  - Polling station management
  - Result tabulation

- **Voter API**:
  - Voter registration
  - Vote casting
  - Vote verification
  - Election status checking

### 4. Frontend Applications

User interfaces for different stakeholders:

- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - Election creation and management
  - Candidate registration
  - Results visualization
  - System monitoring

- **Voter Portal**:
  - Voter registration
  - Vote casting
  - Vote verification
  - Result viewing

- **Polling Station Interface**:
  - Voter verification
  - Assisted voting
  - Station management
  - Real-time status updates

## Data Flow

### Voter Registration Process

1. Voter provides Aadhar and Voter ID information
2. Identity API verifies credentials with government databases
3. Zero-knowledge proof is generated to protect voter privacy
4. Identity chaincode registers the voter on the blockchain
5. Voter receives confirmation of registration

### Voting Process

1. Voter authenticates using biometrics and identity documents
2. Identity API verifies voter eligibility
3. Identity chaincode issues a voting token
4. Voter casts vote using the token
5. Voting chaincode records the vote on the blockchain
6. Voter receives a receipt for verification

### Result Tabulation Process

1. Admin initiates result calculation after election end time
2. Voting chaincode tallies votes across all constituencies
3. Results are committed to the blockchain
4. Admin dashboard displays results
5. Results can be independently verified by any authorized party

## Security Features

- **Privacy Preservation**:
  - Zero-knowledge proofs for voter verification
  - Private data collections for sensitive information
  - Channels per constituency for data isolation

- **Immutability and Transparency**:
  - All transactions recorded on the blockchain
  - Distributed ledger prevents tampering
  - Auditable transaction history

- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - Multi-factor authentication for voters
  - Role-based access control for administrators
  - Certificate-based security for blockchain nodes

- **Protection Against Common Vulnerabilities**:
  - Prevention of double voting
  - Protection against ballot stuffing
  - Resistance to Sybil attacks

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment

- Docker containers for local development
- Special configuration for M1/M2 Macs using Rosetta 2
- Mock services for identity verification

### Production Environment

- Distributed nodes across geographical locations
- High-availability configuration
- Secure network connections
- Regular backup and disaster recovery

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with actual Aadhar and Voter ID verification systems
- Enhanced biometric verification
- Mobile application for voters
- Advanced analytics for election monitoring
- Cross-platform compatibility improvements
